#Wishing you a Happy New Year 2k20 !

<p>Before the calendar turns a new leaf over, before the social networking sites get flooded with messages, before the mobile networks get congested, let me take a quiet moment out to wish you a wonderful, happy, healthy and prosperous New Year!</p>

<p>When I have friends like you, every day is a new beginning. Cheers to our friendship! Happy New Year!</p>
