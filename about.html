I am Rakesh Joshi. I am student of grade ten (X). I have come up with the idea to start my blog from GitHub. Moreover, I am more focused on the digitalized things like computers, mobile phones and all. I üòç to work and play with those kind of materials. Speaking frankly, I üòç to play games, travel, do photography & video stuffs and do some productive and passionate works on my free time.
